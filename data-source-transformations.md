## source data
From the source spreadsheet, I copied `JacqueNormalizedData` into a new sheet named `LEDSource.`  I added a column called `MonthNum` and filled it with with a formula (`=MONTH(1&LEFT(F3,3))`) to convert the column `Month` into a number.  

Using this number, I sorted the sheet "chronologically."
